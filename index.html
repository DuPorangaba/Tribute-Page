          <h2 id="headline">Here's a timeline of Aaron Swartz's life:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1986</strong> - Born in <strong>Highland Park</strong> (a suburb of Chicago), Illinois.</li>
            <li><strong>1999</strong> - Aaron Swartz created the website Theinfo.org, a collaborative online library. Theinfo.org made Swartz <strong>the winner</strong> of the ArsDigita Prize.</li>
            <li><strong>2001</strong> - Swartz became a member of the working group that authored the RSS 1.0 web syndication specification.</li>
            <li><strong>2002</strong> - Swartz was <strong>a major contributor</strong> to Markdown, a lightweight markup language for generating HTML, and author of its html2text translator.</li>
            <li><strong>2003</strong> - Swartz <strong>participated very actively as an editor at</strong> the English <strong>Wikipedia</strong> since August 2003, under the username AaronSw.</li>
            <li><strong>2005</strong> - Swartz attended <strong>Stanford University</strong>. During his freshman year, Swartz applied to Y Combinator's very first Summer Founders Program proposing to work on a startup called <strong>Infogami</strong>.  After working on Infogami, Aaron opted not to return to Stanford, choosing instead to continue to develop and seek funding for Infogami.</li>
            <li><strong>2006</strong> -  In 2006, he ran unsuccessfully for the Wikimedia Foundation's Board of Trustees. Furthermore, <strong><em>Swartz wrote an analysis of how Wikipedia articles are written</em></strong>, and concluded that the bulk of the actual content comes from tens of thousands of occasional contributors, or "outsiders", each of whom may not make many other contributions to the site, while a core group of 500 to 1,000 regular editors tend to correct spelling and other formatting errors.</li>
            <li><strong>2007</strong> - Swartz joined with Infogami co-founder Simon Carstensen to launch a new firm Jottit in another attempt <strong><em>to create another markdown driven content management system in Python</em></strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>2008</strong> - One of his more notorious works that supports activism is <strong>Deaddrop</strong>, now renamed to SecureDrop, <em>a platform for secure communication between journalists and sources (whistleblowers)</em> used at several news organizations, including ProPublica, The Intercept, The Guardian, and The Washington Post. Besides that, in 2008, <strong>Swartz downloaded about 2.7 million federal court documents stored in the PACER</strong> (Public Access to Court Electronic Records) in an effort to make them available outside of the expensive service.</li>
            <li><strong>2009</strong> - In 2009, wanting to learn about effective activism, Swartz helped launch the <strong>Progressive Change Campaign Committee</strong>. Swartz led the first activism event of his career with the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, delivering thousands of "Honor Kennedy" petition signatures to Massachusetts legislators asking them to fulfill former Senator Ted Kennedy's last wish by appointing a senator to vote for health care reform. </li>
            <li><strong>2010</strong> - He became a research fellow at Harvard University's Safra Research Lab on Institutional Corruption, directed by Lawrence Lessig. And he founded the online group Demand Progress, <strong>known for its campaign against the Stop Online Piracy Act</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>2011</strong> - Swartz was <strong>arrested</strong> by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) police on state breaking-and-entering charges, <strong>after connecting a computer to the MIT network in an unmarked and unlocked closet, and setting it to download academic journal articles systematically from JSTOR</strong> using a guest user account issued to him by MIT. </li>
            <li><strong>2012</strong> - Federal prosecutors later charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, carrying <strong>a cumulative maximum penalty of $1 million in fines, 35 years in prison, asset forfeiture, restitution, and supervised release</strong>. During plea negotiations with Swartz's attorneys, the prosecutors offered to recommend a sentence of six months in a low-security prison, if Swartz would plead guilty to 13 federal crimes. <strong>Swartz</strong> and his lead attorney <strong>rejected that deal</strong>, opting instead for a trial in which prosecutors would have been forced to justify their pursuit of Swartz.</li>
            <li><strong>2013</strong> - He <strong>committed suicide at the age of 26</strong>. After his death, federal prosecutors dropped the charges. Moreover, Swartz was inducted posthumously into the Internet Hall of Fame. </li>
          </ul>
