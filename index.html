          <h2 id="headline">Here's a timeline of Aaron Swartz's life:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1986</strong> - Born in Highland Park (a suburb of Chicago), Illinois.</li>
            <li><strong>1999</strong> - Aaron Swartz created the website Theinfo.org, a collaborative online library. Theinfo.org made Swartz the winner of the ArsDigita Prize, given to young people who create "useful, educational, and collaborative" noncommercial websites.</li>
            <li><strong>2001</strong> - Swartz became a member of the working group that authored the RSS 1.0 web syndication specification.</li>
            <li><strong>2002</strong> - Swartz was a major contributor to Markdown, a lightweight markup language for generating HTML, and author of its html2text translator.  The syntax for Markdown was influenced by Swartz's earlier atx language (2002), which today is primarily remembered for its syntax for specifying headers, known as atx-style headers.</li>
            <li><strong>2003</strong> - Swartz participated very actively as an editor at the English Wikipedia since August 2003, under the username AaronSw.</li>
            <li><strong>2005</strong> - Swartz attended Stanford University. During his freshman year, Swartz applied to Y Combinator's very first Summer Founders Program proposing to work on a startup called Infogami designed as a flexible content management system to allow the creation of rich and visually interesting websites or a form of wiki for structured data.  After working on Infogami with co-founder Simon Carstensen over the summer of 2005, Aaron opted not to return to Stanford, choosing instead to continue to develop and seek funding for Infogami. As part of his work on Infogami, Swartz created the web.py web application framework because he was unhappy with other available systems in the Python programming language.</li>
            <li><strong>2006</strong> -  In 2006, he ran unsuccessfully for the Wikimedia Foundation's Board of Trustees. Furthermore, Swartz wrote an analysis of how Wikipedia articles are written, and concluded that the bulk of the actual content comes from tens of thousands of occasional contributors, or "outsiders", each of whom may not make many other contributions to the site, while a core group of 500 to 1,000 regular editors tend to correct spelling and other formatting errors. According to Swartz: "the formatters aid the contributors, not the other way around." His conclusions, based on the analysis of edit histories of several randomly selected articles, contradicted the opinion of Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, who believed the core group of regular editors were providing most of the content while thousands of others contributed to formatting issues. Swartz came to his conclusions by counting the total number of characters added by an editor to a particular article, while Wales counted the total number of edits. Swartz created numerous articles on United States political institutions, government officials, and writers, among other subjects.</li>
            <li><strong>2007</strong> - Swartz joined with Infogami co-founder Simon Carstensen to launch a new firm Jottit in another attempt to create another markdown driven content management system in Python.</li>
            <li><strong>2008</strong> - Swartz founded Watchdog.net, "the good government site with teeth," to aggregate and visualize data about politicians. In the same year, he wrote a widely circulated Guerilla Open Access Manifesto. One of his more notorious works that supports activism is Deaddrop, now renamed to SecureDrop, a platform for secure communication between journalists and sources (whistleblowers) used at several news organizations, including ProPublica, The Intercept, The Guardian, and The Washington Post. Besides that, in 2008, Swartz downloaded about 2.7 million federal court documents stored in the PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records) database managed by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. The Huffington Post characterized his actions this way: "Swartz downloaded public court documents from the PACER system in an effort to make them available outside of the expensive service. The move drew the attention of the FBI, which ultimately decided not to press charges as the documents were, in fact, public."PACER was charging 8 cents per page for information that Carl Malamud, who founded the nonprofit group Public.Resource.Org, contended should be free, because federal documents are not covered by copyright. The fees were "plowed back to the courts to finance technology, but the system [ran] a budget surplus of some $150 million, according to court reports," reported The New York Times. PACER used technology that was "designed in the bygone days of screechy telephone modems ... put[ting] the nation's legal system behind a wall of cash and kludge." Malamud appealed to fellow activists, urging them to visit one of 17 libraries conducting a free trial of the PACER system, download court documents, and send them to him for public distribution. After reading Malamud's call for action, Swartz used a Perl computer script running on Amazon cloud servers to download the documents, using credentials belonging to a Sacramento library.</li>
            <li><strong>2009</strong> - In 2009, wanting to learn about effective activism, Swartz helped launch the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. Swartz led the first activism event of his career with the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, delivering thousands of "Honor Kennedy" petition signatures to Massachusetts legislators asking them to fulfill former Senator Ted Kennedy's last wish by appointing a senator to vote for health care reform. </li>
            <li><strong>2010</strong> - He became a research fellow at Harvard University's Safra Research Lab on Institutional Corruption, directed by Lawrence Lessig. And he founded the online group Demand Progress, known for its campaign against the Stop Online Piracy Act.</li>
            <li><strong>2011</strong> - Swartz was arrested by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) police on state breaking-and-entering charges, after connecting a computer to the MIT network in an unmarked and unlocked closet, and setting it to download academic journal articles systematically from JSTOR using a guest user account issued to him by MIT. </li>
            <li><strong>2012</strong> - Federal prosecutors later charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $1 million in fines, 35 years in prison, asset forfeiture, restitution, and supervised release. During plea negotiations with Swartz's attorneys, the prosecutors offered to recommend a sentence of six months in a low-security prison, if Swartz would plead guilty to 13 federal crimes. Swartz and his lead attorney rejected that deal, opting instead for a trial in which prosecutors would have been forced to justify their pursuit of Swartz.</li>
            <li><strong>2013</strong> - He committed suicide at the age of 26. After his death, federal prosecutors dropped the charges. Moreover, Swartz was inducted posthumously into the Internet Hall of Fame. </li>
